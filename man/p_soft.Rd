\item{Albumin}{numeric vector of serum albumin in g/l}

\item{Dx}{numeric vector of whether on dialysis before transplant (1 = "yes", 0 = "no")}

\item{ICU}{numeric vector of whether patients in intensive care unit before transplant (1 = "yes", 0 = "no")}

\item{Admitted}{numeric vector of whether admitted to hospital pre-transplant (1 = "yes", 0 = "no")}

\item{MELD}{numeric vector of MELD scores}

\item{LifeSupport}{numeric vector of whether on life support pre-transplant (1 = "yes", 0 = "no")}

\item{Encephalopathy}{numeric vector of whether encephalopathy present (1 = "yes", 0 = "no")}

\item{PVThrombosis}{numeric vector of whether portal vein thrombosis (1 = "yes", 0 = "no")}

\item{Ascites}{numeric vector of whether ascites pre-transplant (1 = "yes", 0 = "no")}

\item{Units}{optional scalar for albumin units (one of "SI" for g/l, "US" for g/dl)}
}
\value{
numeric vector of P-SOFT scores
}
\description{
A vectorised function to calculate the pre-procurement component of the SOFT score used to
predict patient survival after liver transplantation. The function needs the MELD score as one of
its inputs - this is available using the transplantr::meld() function.
The units for albumin are g/l but this
is changed to g/dl if the optional Units parameter is set to "US"
